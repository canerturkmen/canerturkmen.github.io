``View of Constantinople and the Bosphorus,'' by the Armenian-Russian romantic [Ivan Aivazovsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Aivazovsky), 1856.
The view is from the Tophane district towards the south, Hali√ß (the Golden Horn) and the historical peninsula.
Prominent in the view is the Nusretiye (Tophane) Mosque, notable for its Baroque style and ornate "crown" around the dome. Its three centuries older neighbor, Kilic Ali Pasha Mosque is hidden from view on the right.
In the distance, shores of Kadikoy (Chalcedon)--the Asian side of Istanbul-- feature on the left. On the right is the historical seat of three empires to have ruled from the city: Sarayburnu, Topkapi Palace, and Hagia Sophia on the left and Beyazit watch tower on the far right.
For us rationalists, note that the direction of view is due south and the sun would neither rise nor set at the shown bearing at any time of the year in Istanbul.
